GOLD RESERVES	Most of the world's gold reserves, estimated at 1 billion ounces, are in South Africa, and that country will continue to produce two-thirds of the world's gold supply for many years. The U.S.S.R. is thought to have a large part of the remainder, and no other country has more than a few percent of the reserves. Official world gold currency reserves are about 1.3 billion ounces, and a somewhat smaller amount is hoarded; both reserves and hoards may become sources of industrial gold, the first by government decision, the second by a sufficient rise in the price of gold.	Nonmonetary consumption of gold in the United States has been three to four times domestic production for several years, and the United States is unlikely to become self-sufficient in gold in the foreseeable future. United States gold reserves of a few tens of millions of ounces are mainly in the Homestake (South Dakota) and Carlin and Cortez (Nevada) gold deposits and in copper deposits, such as Bingham (Utah), which produce byproduct gold. U.S. gold resources are large but in general very low grade, and most placer deposits pose insurmountable technologic problems at present. Deposits as yet undiscovered that are most likely to provide new gold production are those of disseminated gold, similar to Carlin and Cortez, which were overlooked in early prospecting.ÿ(RunArray runs: #(14 2 74 12 102 8 420 13 10 19 217 9 20 6 5 6 56 7 365 ) values: #(14 1 10 11 10 11 10 11 10 12 10 49 10 49 10 49 10 49 10 ))
